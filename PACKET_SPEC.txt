WHEN:	September 2009
WHO:	michael.russe@cox.net
WHAT:	Controlling an IntelliFlow VS pump sans Pentair controller.

WHY:	I bought an IntelliFlow VS pump for my pool in 2007 and was surprised
        to learn that I had to get a Pentair Controller to use most of its
        advanced features. Granted, you can run it like a 'regular pump' by
        switching power ON/OFF and get the benefit of a variable speed pump that
        can regulate its flow, but you are stuck with a manual setting of the
        flow rate on the pump.
        Talking to Pentair, I was told out that the protocol on the RS485 bus
        is proprietary and therefore there is no documentation available to
        anybody.
        The most cost effective Pentair solution to this problem is the Pentair
        IntelliCom* controller, that will 'talk' to the pump in response to
        activation of one of 4 inputs if the pump is in the 'right' mode. It is
        still a $385 list solution with the only benefit being able to run
        4 different 'Ext.Ctrl' programs on a VS or to select one of the 4 speeds
        of a 4x160. This is, at least in my book, not good enough to justify the
        investment, so I put this project on the shelf until I had some more
        time to deal with this shortcoming.
        Early 2009 research on the Internet surfaced that the hardware protocol
        is 9600N81 and that this bus is quite active once a Pentair controller
        is on it, which explained why one does not see any activity if one
        looks for data in a system with just 'the pump'. It turns out the pump
        is quite communicative once you know how to ask it for information. In
        addition to that it will take instructions on what to do!
        Called Pentair again, they had not changed their position on sharing
        the protocol, this time around I was told some mambo about safety ...
        so I decided to figure out what is so special about it, that they will
        not share this information.

HOW:	I wrote a collection of small programs on a Linux system that put me
	into the position to monitor and log bus traffic on a life Pentair bus
	with a controller that is running the show. All one needs is a cheap
	RS485 adapter hooked up to a serial port of a computer. Friends chimed
	in and sent me lots of raw data from their systems for analysis.

HOWTO:	This collection comes with a Makefile and all the sources. A 'make'
	does compile all programs in the current directory on a Linux 2.6.21.5
	with make 3.81 and gcc 3.4.1. There are NO errors or warnings!
	(FYI: on my system 'vi' is setup with 'ts=8 sw=8')
	It helps to be fluent in 'C' and Linux to understand and modify the
	programs. Due to portability and demonstration purposes all programs
	are single threaded and use the 'select' system call to do multi point
	I/O and timeouts.
	An understanding of sockets helps, but is not really necessary. The
	important thing is that a SOCK_DGRAM socket in Linux never returns
	an incomplete packet on a read() call as long as the packets are small.
	This is not true for the <tty> interface, since it is byte oriented
	and does not do packages without a defined end of package indicator,
	which does not exist in this application.


APRS485 access point to RS485 network
=====================================

NAME	aprs485 - RS485 access point
USAGE	aprs485 [-<options>] <bus>
INFO	All programs in this collection use the servives of this access point
	server to communicate with the RS485 half-duplex bus. The access point
	uses datagrams for communication. It provides the ability for multiple
	programs to share the physical RS485 bus. Programs connect to 'tabs'
	in the access point server. All 'tabs' receive data occurring on the
	bus and may send data to the bus.

	<bus>	can be either a <tty> like '/dev/ttyS4' with a RS485 adapter or
		an IP address of a tunnel device port. A tunnel device could be
		the TCP port of a wireless communication endpoint.

	options:

	-d	Debug mode, aprs485 will not go into the background and print
		all activity of the access point with a timestamp.
		Hit <Escape> to terminate the program.

	-p <#>	Use alternate portnumber <#> as server port (default is 10485).
		This comes in handy if you need to run two or more instances of
		'aprs485' on the same computer.

	-l <dir> Creates log files in directory <dir>. The filenames used are
		constructed from the current date on the machine: 'YYMMDD.log'.
		Files are appended to and created if they don't exist. The log
		file records are ASCII, 1 record per line. They start with the
		date followed by a timestamp, a single character record type,
		a size field and the message. Most messages are a hexadecimal
		representation of data on the bus.

API	'aprs485.h' contains code to support 'easy' attachment to a tab.
	#define APRS485_API 1
	#include "aprs485.h"
	int main(int ac, char **av)
	{
		int	bd, n;
		char	msg[128];

		if ((bd = hub_at(0,0)) < 0) return -1;
		n = read(bd,msg,sizeof(msg)); /* would be a receive */
		if (0) write(bd,"hello",5); /* would be a send */
		hub_dt(bd);
		return 0;
	}


The protocol
============

	The protocol uses short binary packages for information exchange. The
	packages have variable size. The minimum length is 8 bytes and the
	theoretical maximum is 6+256+2=264 bytes. The largest I have seen on
	a live Pentair bus is 37 bytes.
	The format is:

	<ldb> <sub> <dst> <src> <cfi> <len> [<data>] <ckh> <ckl>

	10 <lpb> - leading packet byte, 0xa5
	11 <sub> - ?
	12 <dst> - destination address
	13 <src> - source address
	14 <cfi> - command/function/instruction
	15 <len> - size of data field (may be 0!)
	16 <data ...>
	<ckh> - most significant byte of checksum
	<ckl> - least significant byte of checksum

	The checksum is a 16 bit unsigned sum of all bytes in the message up to
	the checksum field.
	Most packages are preceded by a preamble of 1 or more 0xff bytes and a
	0x00 0xff sequence.

	Every device on the bus has an address:
	0x0f - is the broadcast address, it is used by the more sophisticated
	       controllers as <dst> in their system status broadcasts most
	       likely to keep queries for system status low.
	0x1x - main controllers (IntelliComII, IntelliTouch, EasyTouch ...)
	0x2x - remote controllers
	0x6x - pumps, 0x60 is pump 1

	Apart from unsolicited broadcasts, information exchange is done by
	a device A sending a message to device B and device B sending an answer
	to device A. Messages for simple exchanges only differ in the fact
	that <dst> and <src> are swapped.
	For example:
		C: A5 00 60 10 04 01 ff 02 19
		P: A5 00 10 60 04 01 ff 02 19
	is a request from the controller to the pump to turn panel control off,
	which enables it to send other commands to the pump. The pump confirms
	the action in the answer.
	The following sequence will turn panel control back on:
		C: A5 00 60 10 04 01 00 01 1A
		P: A5 00 10 60 04 01 00 01 1A

	The interpretation of a <cfi> depends on the destination of a message,
	meaning a <cfi> for one device might mean something else for another.

	And there are exceptions to this protocol. The IntelliChlor C40 puts
	messages on the bus that start with a 0x10 0x02 sequence, a data field,
	a single byte checksum and a 0x10 0x03 trailer sequence... The checksum
	is the unsigned sum over the data field + 18.

	There are many <cfi>s I have seen in data dumps, the interpretation of
	the datafield is somewhat cumbersome without knowing the system, so my
	focus is more on messages to and from a pump.
	However, here are some basics I found:
	A <cfi> to a controller seems to work like this:
	bits   <76543210>
		00xxxxxx - ?
		01xxxxxx - ?
		10xxxxxx - transfer(write) <cfi>&0x3f to controller
		           controller acknowledges the write with <0x01><0x01><cfi>
		11xxxxxx - request <cfi>&0x3f from controller
		           the controller broadcasts it in response

	My pump is an IntelliFlow VS, it does follow instructions from an
	IntelliComII controller, provided the external programs are setup and
	enabled. It has to be in FILTER mode AND Started to make it go.
	Unlike other controllers, which take over full control of the pump, the
	IntelliComII grabs control only for a short interval of time, every 30
	seconds, to communicate what external program to run. If all inputs are
	off it does not even do that after it has had a respone from the pump.

	The sequence for input 1 active is:

		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=04 l=01 FF       <0219> SETCTRL remote
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=04 l=01 FF       <0219> CTRL is remote
	*	C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=01 l=04 03210008 <0146> WRITE (0x0008) to 0x0321
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=01 l=02 0008     <0120> VALIS (0x0008)
		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=04 l=01 00       <011A> SETCTRL local
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=04 l=01 00       <011A> CTRL is local

	*       C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=01 l=04 03210000 <013E> is a stop
	*	C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=01 l=04 03210010 <014E> is program 2
	*	C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=01 l=04 03210018 <0156> is program 3
	*	C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=01 l=04 03210020 <015E> is program 4

	If one quits repeating the sequence for about a minute the pump stops.
	The IntelliComII is not aware of the status of the pump and will keep
	repeating the sequence as long as an input is active. You can stop and
	start the pump with the START/STOP button on the control panel anytime,
	unless, of course, you hit the period when it is in remote control.

	More decoding of binary data from an IntelliTouch controlled system
	with a VS pump surfaced that there is a status report from the pump.
	It is only obtainable when the pump is in remote control.

		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=07 l=00 <011C> SEND status
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=07 l=0f 0A0602024A08AC120000000A000F22 <028A>
        		RUN 0a   Started
			MOD 06   Feature 1
			PMP 02   ? drive state
			PWR 024a  586 WATT
			RPM 08ac 2220 RPM
			GPM 12     18 GPM
			PPC 00      0 %
			b09 00   ? 
			ERR 00   ok
			b11 0a   ? 
			TMR 00   0 MIN
			CLK 0f22 15:34

	The above sequence is embedded within the cyclic exchange of data
	between the controller and the pump. The full cyclic sequence is:

		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=04 l=01 FF       <0219> SETCTRL remote
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=04 l=01 FF       <0219> CTRL is remote
		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=01 l=04 02E40012 <0212> WRITE (18) to 0x02e4
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=01 l=02 0012 <012A>     VALIS (18)
		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=05 l=01 06       <0121> SETMOD 06 (Feature 1)
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=05 l=01 06       <0121> MOD is 06
		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=06 l=01 0A       <0126> SETRUN 0a Started
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=06 l=01 0A       <0126> RUN is 0a Started
		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=07 l=00          <011C> SEND status
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=07 l=0f 0A0602024908B1120000000A000F22 <028E>

	The controller never releases the pump as long as it is in AUTO mode.
	The display on the pump shows "Display not active..." and the LEDs
	above FEATURE 1 and START/STOP are on. Experiments with my pump showed
	that one can change the GPM setpoint 0x02e4 on the fly, it follows it!
	If the controller releases the pump the cyclic sequence changes to:

		C: A500 d=60 s=10 c=04 l=01 00 <011A> SETCTRL local
		P: A500 d=10 s=60 c=04 l=01 00 <011A> CTRL is local

	It is important for any serious controller implementation to know when a
	pump runs into trouble and the Pentair IntelliFlow VS is fully capable
	of doing that!


Data decoder
============

NAME	padec - pabus data decoder
USAGE	padec [-<options>] <datafile>
INFO	Offline binary <datafile> decoder. Prints to standard output.
	The <datafile> may be a raw dump of traffic from a Pentair
	RS485 bus or the <logfile> of 'palog'.
	Options (default is to 'skip it' if not set):
	-d	decode messages
	-s	print preamble bytes (if you really care)
	-a	print record positions in <datafile>
	-f <#>	print only messages from/to address <#>
	-r	print full decode of repeated messages
	-h	print 'palog' records
	-t	print timestamps, only useful if data is from 'palog'


Should you decide to experiment with the programs below ...

	  	!BE WARE YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!
	  !! THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMS PUT DATA ON THE BUS !!
  ! DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A CONTROLLER IN YOUR SYSTEM !
  ! MAKE SURE YOU CAN KILL POWER TO THE PUMP BY A HW SWITCH ANYTIME !

You will need the HW switch in case things get out of control!
Especially when you start messing with the code and work on a live system.


Simulator Program
=================

NAME	iFlow - IntelliFlow simulator on pabus
USAGE	iFlow [<ap>]
INFO	Attaches to an 'aprs485' tab and emulates bus behavior of an IntelliFlow
	pump. This program can be used to test controller software before you
	let it go for the real thing. It is not a full implementation, but has
	enough to get the basic bugs out of controller programs, and then, one
	can always add to it...
	Program exits if you type 'q' followed by a <Return> or it receives an
	EOT from the hub.


Simple Controller programs
==========================

The programs in this section will exit if they detect traffic on the bus.

NAME	iComII - IntelliComII emulator on pabus
USAGE	iComII [<ap>]
INFO	Interactive program, attaches to access point tab and emulates behavior
	of an IntelliComII controller. It has an 'extra' feature which gives
	you, the user, the ability to pull status from the pump. The pump will
	will follow your commands, if the external programs are setup AND
	it is in FILTER mode AND the START/STOP light is on.
	The commands are:
	q - quit
	s - pump status
	0 - all inputs off
	1 - input 1 active
	2 - input 2 active
	3 - input 3 active
	4 - input 4 active
	The prompt displays the version number of the program, the count down
	timer for the next cyclic transmission and the currently active program
	sent to the pump.
	Program exits if you enter the 'quit' command or it receives an EOT
	from the hub.


NAME	iPump - IntelliFlow controller
USAGE	iPump [<ap>]
INFO	Experimental interactive controller program.
	Program exits if you enter the 'quit' command or it receives an EOT
	from the hub.


NAME	iPmon - IntelliFlow pump status monitor
USAGE	iPmon [<ap>]
INFO	Attaches to access point tab and polls pump status every 15 seconds.
	Program exits if you enter the 'quit' command or it receives an EOT
	from the hub.
